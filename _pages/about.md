I am currently a senior researcher at Alibaba DAMO Academy, focusing on AIGC, especially video generation.
Prior to this, I worked as a research engineer at Tencent TEG, responsible for city generation.

I received my PhD from South China University of Technology (SCUT) under the supervision of Prof. **Qiong Liu**.
During my PhD, I visited the University of California, Merced, where I studied dynamic neural networks under the guidance of Prof. **Ming-Hsuan Yang** and Dr. **Varun Jampani**. 
My academic journey began at SCUT, where I earned my B.Eng. in software engineering.

Beyond research, I actively engage with the academic community as a reviewer for top-tier conferences and enjoy playing computer games in my free time.

**Research Interests**: Video Generation, Image Generation
